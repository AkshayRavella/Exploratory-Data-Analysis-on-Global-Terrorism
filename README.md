# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Dataset-'Terrorism'
- Data Set: https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5
- The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017.
-  The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks.
-   The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland.
# Proposed System
- In the proposed system, we are going to use the Global Terrorism Database to analyze and derive insights on the various terrorism acts that have taken place.
-  We will preprocess the database to get reliable and accurate patterns and insights and use descriptive statistics to draw conclusions such as â€” major causes of terrorism, major groups behind terrorism, categories of the targets, locations of terrorist attacks.
- Using EDA, we will show the trend of the growth of terrorism in the world and how it spread to various parts of the world. 
- Using graphs, we study how one factor behind terrorism is interrelated to the other.
